The plan is gonna be simple:
-create some files like login ,sign-up & main
-edit them with seperate css or one and only alone lets talk about that later
-routing them together as one app
-adding storage like firebase 
-connecting the storage with other parts of the app like login details
-hosting the app let try to use git for simplicity
